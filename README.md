### Setup
Setup: Provide instructions on setting up the project environment and downloading necessary data. Include any libraries or dependencies required.

### Loading Data and Preprocessing
Loading Data and Preprocessing: Explain how the CT scans are loaded, processed, normalized, and resized using functions like `read_nifti_file`, `normalize`, and `resize_volume`.

### Build Train and Validation Datasets
Build Train and Validation Datasets: Detail how the dataset is split into training and validation sets, and how labels are assigned to abnormal and normal scans.

### Data Augmentation
Data Augmentation: Describe the data augmentation techniques applied, such as rotation, and how they are implemented using functions like `rotate`, `train_preprocessing`, and `validation_preprocessing`.

### Define Data Loaders
Define Data Loaders: Explain the creation of data loaders using TensorFlow's `tf.data.Dataset` API for efficient data handling during training and validation.

### Visualize Data
Visualize Data: Provide code and explanations for visualizing CT scans, either as single slices or montages, to understand the input data better.

### Define 3D Convolutional Neural Network
Define 3D Convolutional Neural Network: Present the architecture of the CNN model, including the layers used, such as convolutional, max-pooling, batch normalization, and dense layers.
